    This test is to ensure that the workflow running in community mode
    completes successfully on the RRFS_CONUS_25km grid using the HRRR
    physics suite with ICs derived from the FV3GFS and LBCs derived from
    the RAP.
    Note that this test specifies the file format of the FV3GFS external
    model data (from which to generate ICs) to be "grib2" as opposed to
    the default value of "nemsio".
