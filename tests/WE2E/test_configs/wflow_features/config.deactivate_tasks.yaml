    This test has two purposes:
    1) It checks that the various workflow tasks can be deactivated, i.e.
       removed from the Rocoto XML.
    2) It checks the capability of the workflow to use "template" experiment
       variables, i.e. variables whose definitions include references to
       other variables, e.g.
         MY_VAR='\${ANOTHER_VAR}'
    Note that we do not deactivate all tasks in the workflow; we leave the
    MAKE_GRID_TN, MAKE_OROG_TN, and MAKE_SFC_CLIMO_TN activated because:
    1) There is already a WE2E test that runs with these three tasks
       deactivated (that test is to ensure that pre-generated grid,
       orography, and surface climatology files can be used).
    2) In checking the template variable capability, we want to make sure
       that the variable defintions file (GLOBAL_VAR_DEFNS_FN) generated
       does not have syntax or other errors in it by sourcing it in these
       three tasks.
