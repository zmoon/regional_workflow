    This test checks the capability of the workflow to run ensemble forecasts
    that require the forecast model to write output files and perform post-
    processing on a sub-hourly time interval.
    This test is needed in addition to the one named "subhourly_post"
    because in the jinja template file from which the rocoto workflow XML
    is generated, the code changes that were made to add the subhourly
    capability also involved changes to the ensemble capability.
