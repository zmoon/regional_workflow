    This test checks the capability of the workflow to retrieve from NOAA
    HPSS files generated by the HRRR external model from which ICs (and
    the LBCs at the 0th forecast hour) will be derived and files from the
    RAP external model from which the LBCs (except for the ones at the 0th
    forecast hour) will be derived.
