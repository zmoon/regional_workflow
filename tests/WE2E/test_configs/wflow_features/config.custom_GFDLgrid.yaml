    This test checks the capability of the workflow to have the user
    specify a new grid (as opposed to one of the predefined ones in the
    workflow) of GFDLgrid type.  Note that this test sets the workflow
    variable
      GFDLgrid_USE_NUM_CELLS_IN_FILENAMES
    to "TRUE" (which is its default value); see the UFS SRW App's User's
    Guide for a description of this variable.
    The difference between this test and the one named
      new_GFDLgrid__GFDLgrid_USE_NUM_CELLS_IN_FILENAMES_eq_TRUE
    is that this one uses almost no stretching by setting the workflow
    variable GFDLgrid_STRETCH_FAC very close to 1.  Setting it exactly to
    1 used to cause the workflow to fail because it caused the GFDL grid
    generator to assume a global grid.  This bug should be rechecked, e.g.
    by setting GFDLgrid_STRETCH_FAC to exactly 1 below.  If the grid
    generation succeeds, then this test can be removed.
